## Overview
### Description
Death app would help users prepare for their demise or for when they would be in an accident (or any other major emergency situation).
Trivial things such as leaving a message for loved ones or passing on a verified will. We all need to prepare for our inevitable demise
in some way. Death app is meant to guide people through that process.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity / Mental Health
- **Mobile:** Death app doesn't necessarily have to be a mobile app. It can also be a web app. Making it accessible to USSD or just by filling out
forms may be viable in some places.
- **Story:** A user leaves a message for a loved one. When they pass away, that message is delivered to their loved one. A user may also write their will
which would be verified by their attorney if they have one or by people they added as verifiers. The app may provided asset management in a limited manner.
- **Market:** At first the market would be a small area on earth, may be a country. However, going global is the main aim. Any human being
may need to prepare for the time they would be gone.
- **Habit:** Taking a glance every few days to adjust some of the asset values as well as the will. However, it may also take a few months
before someone may need to adjust something. Putting in reminders to get small pieces done would be a great addition.
- **Scope:** First, we would add the capability of users to leave a message. Then add a will section. Then add automatic death detection.
